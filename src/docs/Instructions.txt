How to create a simulator

1. Implement ISimulationEvent or extend AbstractEvent to describe the 
state-changing events of your system

2. Define the system state
2.1 Implement IState.update(). This method changes the state of the system 
on the occurence of an event
2.2 Optionally implement IStateMemento to save state information 
before effecting a transition.
NOTE: If you do not implement the memento then the StateTransitionEvent
will have null for the old state

3. Implement IEventProcess or extend AbstractEventProcess.
If you extend AdvancedEventProcess you only need to define update()
to describe how changes in the state affect the event queue.
You can use the insert() method for inserting newly created events.
NOTE: If you extend AbstractEventProcess or make your EventProcess 
implement IStateTransitionListener, the simulator will automatically
update your event process when a state transition occurs, otherwise
you must manually update the event process 
(or predefine all the events that will occur in the simulation)

4. You are ready to create a simulator:
4.1. Instantiate a Simulator using your state and event process.
4.2. Register state transition listeners. Any accumulators that 
     extend SimulationAccumulator will be automatically registered.
